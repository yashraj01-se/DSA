# ⚡ Data Structures and Algorithms — yashraj01-se

This repository is a complete collection of my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice work — implemented in **C++** and organized topic-wise.  
It includes problems from **Striver’s DSA Sheet**, **standard algorithms**, and self-written code for mastering problem-solving fundamentals.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 🧠 **Core Fundamentals**
- `Bacics/` – syntax, I/O, time complexity, and basic problem setups  
- `stl/` – Standard Template Library: vectors, sets, maps, stacks, queues, etc.  

### 🔢 **Array & Searching**
- `Array/` – array manipulation, subarrays, prefix sums  
- `BINARY SEARCH/` – classic problems and pattern-based searching  

### 🔁 **Recursion & Backtracking**
- `Recursion/` – recursive patterns, subsets, permutations  
- Includes base and advanced recursion exercises  

### 🌳 **Tree & Linked List**
- `TREE/` – traversals, BSTs, height, diameter, lowest common ancestor  
- `linked list/` – single/double linked lists, reverse, cycle detection  

### 🔗 **Dynamic Programming & Graphs**
- `DP/` – memoization, tabulation, subsequence problems  
- `Graph/` – BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, cycle detection, topological sort  

### 🧮 **Sorting & Algorithms**
- `sorting/` – bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quicksort, counting sort  

### 🧾 **Striver DSA Sheet**
- `Striver dsa/` – structured solutions following Striver’s 180/450 DSA roadmap

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A **learning archive** of algorithms and data structures  
- A **reference** for common DSA patterns and techniques  
- A **portfolio** showing consistent problem-solving practice  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Languages:** C++
- **Editor:** VS Code

## ⚙️ How to Run

### ▶️ For C++ Files
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
````
